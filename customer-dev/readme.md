### Answers

1. `Customer Development` is simply about questioning your core business assumptions.
1. The four major aspects of customer development are: `Customer Discovery`, `Customer Validation`, `Company Creation`, and `Company Building`.
1. `Customer Discovery`, a product solves a problem for an identifiable group of users.
1. `Customer Validation`, the market is saleable and large enough that a viable business might be built.
1. `Company Creation`, the business is scalable through repeatable sales and marking road map.
1. `Company Building`, company departments and operational processes are created to support scale.
1. `Customer Discovery` is composed of: **problem-solution fit, proposed MVP, and proposed funnels.**
1. `Customer Validation` is composed of: **product-market fit, business model, and sales & marketing road map.**
1. `Company Creation` is composed of: **scale execution.**
1. `Company Building` is composed of: **scale organization, and scale operations.**
1. As an entrepreneur, it's your responsibility to **make decisions based on tested hypothesis, rather than untested assumptions.** The results of the customer development process may reveal that your assumptions regarding the market and/or customer are wrong. It is **your responsibility**, as the idea-generator, to interpret the data you have elicited and modify your next set of assumptions to iterate upon.
1. The three levels to discussing customer development are: Understand the philosophy, apply the principles to your specific business, lay concrete steps to take.
1. **"Question your assumptions"**, separate the zeal of entrepreneurship from the blindness of hubris. Pivot your way to achieving your vision or let the market guide you to a different conclusion.
1. This chapter covers the progression a startup used to develop and test their theories. They created a series of small and iterative technologies to test customer behaviors and interactions. They used each feature or "mini-app" to inform their hypothesis and develop additional technologies to further deepen their understandings of customers. As they evolved their understandings they continued to refine the product and develop their business model.
1. Early adopters are early users of new technology or products who understand its value before mainstream markets. Acquiring early adopters is important to understand product adoption.
1. Early adopters seek out new technology to solve their problems, not just for the sake of owning the newest technologies. They don't rely on references from others to make buying decisions. Early adopters want to help you and want you to be successful, they enjoy opportunities to be heros through solving real world problems.
1. `Segmentation` is the process of breaking down a larger market into smaller identifiable groups of users who share specific needs and who reference each other.
1. `Market segmentation` is often confused with "customer profiles" and "industry verticals".
1. `Market Segments` are comprised of like people, who share a common interest, **who have access to each other and who look to one another as a trusted reference.**
1. No. If these two prospect customers have no means of communicating with one another, despite sharing the same interest, then they are **not** in separate market segments.
1. They are most likely not in the same market segment. As such, both customers would likely need different marketing and sales initiatives.
1. The "point" isn't that individuals within a segment _do_ communicate with one another, but rather that they _have access_ to do so.
1. Finding a market segment, ideally **one segment**, that serves as the "beachhead on the shores" of the early majority is beneficial because this segment is able to spread the knowledge of the product via word of mouth amongst those who share a need and means. Furthermore, the customers within the segment have access to one another and having indirect knowledge through personal recommendations and testimonials of alike individuals buying a product is a powerful influence.
1. Proper segmentation allows you to: learn faster about market fit, find an "unoccupied" segment (no competition), become a market leader (dominate the segment), line up and knock down following segments like bowling pins, and maximizing capital efficiency by focusing existing resources.
